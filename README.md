## Description

Independent Project for Week 5 of Epicodus Coding School featuring the Red, Green, Refactor workflow and the E6 feature class. The business logic of my application will take a person's age in years and create a class that returns a user's age determines a user's age based on a planet's solar years. It will also determines how many years have passed on each planet since a past birthday and how many years have yet to pass until a future birthday.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* 💫 Clone the repo down to your desktop.
* 💫 Open the project and review the functions for adjusting a birthdate to different solar years
* 💫 FYI for non-Mac users: in the package.json "scripts" for lint: line 9's has an extra " ' " surrounding src:... which allows es lint to access files recursively  "lint": "'eslint src/*.js'",

## Known Bugs

* 💫 No known bugs

* 💫 There are more planets that can be added (or removed: thinking of you, Pluto).
